- psu toggling multiple times //psu_worker_dowork //slot_params[i].psu_status != 1 

- makes sure start button not available until psu_status == 1 

- automate 'START' button press after pretest //do_pretest

= when starting and ending each step print FirmwareEn status to CMD prompt log to see that it is in the proper mode.

= ZeroC not booting up properly?
  - IP address returns with 0: capture error and cascade upwards to prevent server from starting. Set mailbox error

= Device current and temperature on BIB picture are not showing any real values for the DUT installed locations.

= always the second(last) slot to power up is the one to toggle the power supply’s on and of two to three times.

= looks like START button appears when first Python dialog passes file, and but not waiting for all python scripts to pass folder information.
check to see if this needs to be fixed before the Automate 'Start' button feature is added. see screen shot "Pretest_StartButton before second passes file excahnge.png"

= the Status Box sould add "Ramping Temperaure" to the period when a temperature is set "lower", and then reached can change the test step name. works for going hotter ramp.

= when running the 7 setp 45C test "UC_FURY_7step_short_test_45C.step.csv" it quickly skips through setp 2&3.



= need to have better indicator when steps file is completed Status is STOPPED and Message bar is Complete, Actually move the Chamber# and Status box to the right over the control area.
	(CN 9/27/19 Changes made directly on the Form1.cs[Design])

= Separate the Imeasure on the BIB display to be individual per Phase.
	(CN 10/3/19 Moved Imeasured into the information tab as requested, created a "ADC" and 'PSU" separation for measurements on form 2.)

= When scanning DUT's/Rescanning Duts Make indication on UI "Busy Gathering Devices" until all devices are checked. Rescan can take ~10 seconds
	(CN 10/1/19 Coded into the main. Refer to CN4 for multiple changes)

= is it possible to make board dialog popup have only one instance, it seems that the same slot can be opened multiple times and then we have multiple floating dialogs.
also update the SLot# in the top left corner to be 1 based.
	(CN 9/27/19 Form1.cs keyword:CN1)

= 8/10/19 Just had an instance where slot 1 went to dark grey in the middle of a run, so step seemed to get stuck.
	(CN 10/3/19 Cannot reproduce)

= The control changes to pretest even if the load is aborted.
	(CN 10/3/19 Cannot reproduce)

= Program EEPROM on BIB for correct Serial Number //memory.py
	(CN 10/4/19 Procedure to do so has been created, and done)

= strange dut detection?
	(CN 10/4/19 Possibly solved the problem? WITH A BIG QUESTION MARK. NEVERMIND! NOPE. WELL KINDA NOW? NOPE.)
